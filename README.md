### What I learned

The most interesting and the only thing that i can think of designing border gradient. I learned it just only by googling it.

```css
.scissorBorder {
  background: linear-gradient(white, white) padding-box,
    linear-gradient(to bottom, hsl(39, 89%, 49%), hsl(40, 84%, 53%)) border-box;
  border: 10px solid transparent;
}
```

### Continued development

I will be needing to improve my css design responsiveness.
